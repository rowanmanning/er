# Er... #

A small set of custom error classes for Node.js.


## Development ##

In order to develop Er..., you'll need to install the following
npm modules globally like so:

    npm install -g coffee-script
    npm install -g jake

And then install development dependencies locally with:

    npm install

Once you have these dependencies, you will be able to run the
following commands:

`jake build`: Build JavaScript from the CoffeeScript source.

`jake test`: Run all unit tests.
